<h1>Connecting to NML from languages (such as Java) other than C++ via sockets.</h1>
<hr>
<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When using languages other than C++ with NML, there are several problems.
The header files with the NML message definitions can not be included. The libraries for managing the NML communications are not available. In the case of
a Java applet the NML configuration file might also not be available. 
One solution to this problem is to link together C++ code with 
the code written in another language into a single program. This was the approach used in the EMC Graphical User Interface which is primarily written in
Visual Basic. Another approach is that the program written in non-C++
connect via sockets to an NML server. However because the NML server has 
many options writing the client might require a great deal of work to support
all the options. Here I will choose a set of options that simplifies the 
interface for a Java client and describe  how the client can be written.
</p>
<h2>NML Configuration</h2>
<p> On each buffer line  for buffers remove any of the following if they were there: (TCP=?, UDP=?, ascii, xdr). 
Then add &quot;STCP=<port>&quot; to set the remote protocol to a simplified TCP protocol to the end of each buffer line. Unlike the normal TCP protocol, each
buffer must have a unique port.
 Add &quot;disp&quot; to set the updater type to the ascii display type.
</p>
<h2>Java Socket Code</h2>
<p>
To open a connection create a new socket, making sure to match the host
and port from the NML configuration file.
<pre>
	String host = "giskard.cme.nist.gov";
	int port = 2001;
	Socket nmlsocket;
	nmlSocket = new Socket(host, port);
</pre>
<p>
Then create a DataInputStream and DataOutputStream using that socket.
</p>
<pre>
	DataOutputStream nmlOs;
	DataInputStream nmlIs;
	nmlOs = new DataOutputStream(nmlSocket.GetOutputStream);
	nmlIs = new DataInputStream(nmlSocket.GetInputStream);
</pre>
<p>
To read from an  NML buffer, write &quot;read:\n&quot; or &quot;peek:&quot; to
the DataOutputStream, then read a line from the DataInputStream. The line will
contain the NML message beginning with the type and size of the message and followed by members in the order the update functions are called. (The size indicates the size of the structure in C++ not the length of the string returned. -- Ignore it.) The parameters are seperated by commas. Below is an example of how to parse this string.
</p>
<pre>
	// Recieve the current position.
	String nmlMsgString;
	long type;
	long size;
	float x;
	int index;
	nmlOs.writeBytes(&quot;read:\n&quot;);
	nmlMsgString = nmlIs.ReadLine();
	// nmlMsgString might look like this &quot;8010,32,5.0,-25.0,0.7&quot;
	type = Long.valueOf(nmlMsgString);
	index = nmlMsgString.indexOf(",");
	size = Long.valueOf(nmlMsgString.substring(index));
	index = nmlMsgString.indexOf(",",index);
	x = Float.valueOf(nmlMsgString.substring(index));
</pre>
To write to a NML buffer send write &quot;write:&quot; or  &quot;write_if_read:&quot; followed by the message in the same form as they are read in, begining with the type and size followed by members seperated by commas. It is not neccessary to provide all of the members of the message. Members ommitted from the end of the string will be considered to be zero. It is also not neccessary to
calculate the size of the message, but a place holder is neccessary if there are any other members to set in the string.
<pre>
	// Send the command to goto x,0,0
	nmlOs.writeBytes(&quot;8001,0,&quot; + Double(x).toString());
</pre>

<h2>A Complete Example</h2>
<p>
This example consists of 3 programs:

<OL>
<LI>A C++ pseudo controller 
which accepts commands and updates a world model buffer. (<A HREF="http://isd.cme.nist.gov/~shackle/socapplet/wtimer.cc">wtimer.cc</a>,<A HREF="http://isd.cme.nist.gov/~shackle/socapplet/timetype.cc">timetype.cc</a>, and <A HREF="http://isd.cme.nist.gov/~shackle/socapplet/timetype.hh">timetype.hh</a>)</LI>
<LI>A C++ server which passes messages back and forth between remote processes and the local buffers read and updated by the controller.(<A HREF="http://isd.cme.nist.gov/~shackle/socapplet/timesvr.cc">timesvr.cc</a>,<A HREF="http://isd.cme.nist.gov/~shackle/socapplet/timetype.cc">timetype.cc</a>, and <A HREF="http://isd.cme.nist.gov/~shackle/socapplet/timetype.hh">timetype.hh</a>)<LI>
<LI>A Java Applet that sends
commands when buttons are pushed and polls the world model for display.
(<A HREF="http://isd.cme.nist.gov/~shackle/socapplet/socapplet.java">socapplet.java</a> and <A HREF="http://isd.cme.nist.gov/~shackle/socapplet/CountButton.java">CountButton.java</a>)</LI>
</OL>

<p>
The applet looks somewhat like a stopwatch. The controller doesn't have any
hardware to control so I simulate world model by just updating the time
in the world model buffer. Since we lack the computing resources here
to run a separate controller for each user that starts the applet, pressing
reset, start, or stop changes not only your display but also the display
of anyone else veiwing this applet.
